# EcoTRONomy

EcoTRONomy integrates carbon offsetting mechanisms into the TRON blockchain. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to enable liquidity and versatility of carbon credits by tokenizing and bridging them to the TRON ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- **Carbon Offset Transactions**: Users can initiate carbon offset transactions through the TRON network, specifying the receiver address, the amount of funds, and the offset type and amount.
- **Carbon Offset API**: The API calculates the required carbon offset amount, allows selection of carbon credits, and manages transaction processing and receipts.
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure and efficient smart contracts for managing carbon credit bridging, pooling, burning, and NFT receipt generation.
- **Database Management**: Robust system for storing transaction data, carbon offset details, and receipts.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Tools for tracking system performance, API usage, and carbon offsetting statistics.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation for the Carbon Offset API, smart contracts, and system architecture.
