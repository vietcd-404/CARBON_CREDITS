Here's a detailed step-by-step handbook on how to run the Hardhat test scripts:

Prerequisites:

Node.js installed on your computer.
Hardhat installed globally: npm install -g hardhat.

Step 1: Set up the Hardhat project

Create a new folder for your project: mkdir carbon-credit-marketplace && cd carbon-credit-marketplace.
Run npx hardhat to set up a new Hardhat project. Choose "Create a sample project" when prompted.
Move your Solidity contracts to the contracts folder.
Move your test scripts to the test folder.
Install the necessary dependencies for your project: npm install.

Step 2: Configure Hardhat

Open the hardhat.config.js file in the root of your project.
Configure the Solidity compiler version and other settings. For example:

javascript
Copy code

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
  networks: {
    // Configure your networks here
  },
  paths: {
    tests: './test', // This is the default path; you can change it if your tests are in a different folder
  },
};


Step 3: Install dependencies and compile the contracts

Compile the contracts: npx hardhat compile.
Step 4: Run the test scripts

Run the test scripts: npx hardhat test.
The command will execute your test scripts, and you will see the results in the console. If there are any errors or failed tests, you will get detailed information about the issues.

Optional: Run specific test scripts

If you have multiple test scripts and want to run only specific ones, you can use the --grep flag followed by a keyword or regular expression to match the desired test description:

Run specific test scripts: npx hardhat test --grep "MasterContract".
This command will run only the tests with descriptions containing the word "MasterContract".

That's it! You've successfully run the Hardhat test scripts for your smart contracts. You can now iterate on your contracts and tests, fixing any issues and making improvements as needed.
