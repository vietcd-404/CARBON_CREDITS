b. Integrate IPFS for storing metadata related to the carbon credits and the verification status.

Burning Contract for Carbon Offsetting:
a. Develop a smart contract for burning ERC20 tokens, allowing users to offset their carbon footprint.
b. Implement an interface for users to interact with the burning contract and view the immutable receipts of the burned carbon credits.

Security and Compliance:
