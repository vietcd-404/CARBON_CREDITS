Here's a step by step implementation and integration plan for each file:

1. Set up the React project:
- Run `npx create-react-app my-app` to create the basic structure of the React app.
- Install required dependencies: `npm install @tronprotocol/tron-web tronlink-lib`

2. Configure TronWeb:
- Create a `src/utils/tronWeb.js` file to set up and export the TronWeb instance.

3. Create and set up the contract instances:
- In `src/utils/contracts.js`, import the TronWeb instance from `tronWeb.js`.
- Add the ABI and contract addresses for the Marketplace, Bridge, ERC1155Token, and WrappedBCT contracts.
- Create and export the contract instances using TronWeb.

4. Implement the Header component:
- Create a `Header.jsx` file in `src/components/Header/` with a functional component that renders the header, including the app title and wallet connection status.
- Add styles for the header in `Header.css`.

5. Implement the App component:
- In `src/components/App/App.jsx`, import the Header component.
- Conditionally render the Customer and Treasury components based on the connected wallet's status (customer or treasury).
- Add the necessary imports and state management logic for wallet connection and user type determination.
- Add styles for the App component in `App.css`.

6. Implement the Customer components:
- BuyCarbonCredits:
  - Create a `BuyCarbonCredits.jsx` file in `src/components/Customer/BuyCarbonCredits/` with a functional component that includes a form to input the token ID, amount, and payment method.
  - Add the necessary event handlers and logic to interact with the Marketplace contract to buy carbon credits.
  - Add styles for the Buy Credits component in BuyCarbonCredits.css.

SellCarbonCredits:
Create a SellCarbonCredits.jsx file in src/components/Customer/SellCarbonCredits/ with a functional component that includes a form to input the token ID, amount, and price per token.
Add the necessary event handlers and logic to interact with the Marketplace contract to sell carbon credits.
Add styles for the SellCarbonCredits component in SellCarbonCredits.css.

OffsetCarbonFootprint:
Create an OffsetCarbonFootprint.jsx file in src/components/Customer/OffsetCarbonFootprint/ with a functional component that includes a form to input the token ID and amount of carbon credits to offset.
Add the necessary event handlers and logic to interact with the Offset contract to offset carbon credits.
Add styles for the OffsetCarbonFootprint component in OffsetCarbonFootprint.css.

7. Implement the Treasury components:

WrapCarbonCredits:
Create a WrapCarbonCredits.jsx file in src/components/Treasury/WrapCarbonCredits/ with a functional component that includes a form to input the amount of carbon credits to wrap.
Add the necessary event handlers and logic to interact with the WrappedBCT contract to wrap carbon credits.
Add styles for the WrapCarbonCredits component in WrapCarbonCredits.css.

BridgeCarbonCredits:
Create a BridgeCarbonCredits.jsx file in src/components/Treasury/BridgeCarbonCredits/ with a functional component that includes a form to input the wrapper address and the amount of WrappedBCT tokens to bridge.
Add the necessary event handlers and logic to interact with the Bridge contract to bridge carbon credits.
Add styles for the BridgeCarbonCredits component in BridgeCarbonCredits.css.

8. Update src/index.js and src/index.css:
Import the necessary dependencies and components in src/index.js.
Wrap the App component with the necessary providers (e.g., TronWebProvider) if required.
Update the src/index.css file with any global styles for the application.

9. Update the .env file:
Add any necessary environment variables such as API keys, contract addresses, and wallet private keys for local development and testing.

10. Write tests:
Create test files for the components and utilities, such as App.test.js, Header.test.js, BuyCarbonCredits.test.js, etc.
Write test cases for the component rendering, state management, event handling, and contract interactions.
Run the tests using the built-in testing framework (npm test).

11. Optimize the application for production:
Check the performance of the application using the built-in React developer tools.
Optimize the code and styles for better performance if necessary.

12. Build the application:
Run npm run build to generate an optimized build for production.

13. Deploy the application:
Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, etc.) and follow their deployment process to make the application publicly accessible.

This step-by-step plan should guide you through the implementation and integration of each file in your frontend project, helping you create a well-structured and functional application that meets your requirements.
