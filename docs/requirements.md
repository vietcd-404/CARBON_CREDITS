 Project idea: The project is a decentralized carbon credit exchange where users can buy and sell carbon credits as ERC1155 tokens. The exchange is designed to promote carbon credits' liquidity, allowing companies and individuals to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing carbon credits from verified emission reduction projects worldwide.

Technical requirements:

The project requires a smart contract for the carbon credit ERC1155 token.

The project requires a smart contract for wrapping ERC20 tokens, such as carbon credits, into ERC1155 tokens.

The project requires a smart contract for the carbon credit exchange.

The project requires a Web3.js client to interact with the smart contracts.

The project requires the use of OpenZeppelin libraries for contract development and testing.

The project requires a blockchain network, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, to deploy and test the smart contracts.

The project requires the use of IPFS or a similar decentralized storage system for storing metadata associated with the ERC1155 tokens.

Communicate with smart contracts via DApp frontend, Web3.js, and Infura.

Functional requirements:

Users should be able to buy and sell carbon credits as ERC1155 tokens on the exchange.

The exchange should verify that carbon credits are coming from legitimate emission reduction projects.

The exchange should allow the conversion of carbon credits from ERC20 tokens to ERC1155 tokens using the WrappedBCT contract.

The exchange should support the addition and removal of supported wrappers.

The exchange should only allow the owner to add or remove supported wrappers.

The ERC1155 token contract should allow for the minting and burning of fungible and non-fungible tokens.

The ERC1155 token contract should only allow the owner or the contract to mint tokens.

The ERC1155 token contract should only allow the owner to burn tokens.

The ERC1155 token contract should allow the setting of the URI for the tokens' metadata. 


Updated Technical and Functional Requirements:

Users should log in by connecting with a wallet provider for the TRON network.

A "customer" wallet should only be able to buy, sell, and offset carbon credits.

The wrapping and bridging of carbon credits should only be possible for a whitelisted wallet that accesses a treasury contract.

The treasury contract should hold Toucan BCT carbon credits for wrapping and bridging to TCO2 carbon credit tokens on the ERC1155 contract.

In the wrapping process, the whitelisted user should have an interface to insert carbon credit data, which is then sent to ipfs for storage. The cid of the stored data on ipfs is added to the wrapper contract. 

For the bridging, the user can select how many of the wrapped bct are to be minted into TCO2 tokens.

The frontend should be developed using React.js and should interact with the TRON network using TronWeb.

The frontend should have separate interfaces for customers and treasury wallets to access the respective functionalities.

The frontend should be responsive and user-friendly.
